- Most files will be PDFs.
	- Would like admin level access to allow other docs (excel, word, ppt)

- Ignore the User Groups column in the Excel list.
	- Access should be granted to folders and individual docs by user (checkbox?) name, not category.

- Add files to each property post
- In the loop get all files and add post name to the select posts that have files associated with them
- Loop through the files and put all of the ones associated with a post in an array


- How do I display single files?
- What does per page mean? Projects per page? What about single files?
