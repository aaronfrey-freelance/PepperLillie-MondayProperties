- Most files will be PDFs.
	- Would like admin level access to allow other docs (excel, word, ppt)

- Ignore the User Groups column in the Excel list.
	- Access should be granted to folders and individual docs by user (checkbox?) name, not category.


- Per page is "Projects" per page, not files

- Create a custom 'Projects' category
- Display the main project date as the last added file date
